This repository contains the resources used for my Bachelor Thesis at Radboud University.

The `thesis_text` folder contains the .tex source files that can be used to generate a PDF document. Within this folder, the embedded media is hosted in `Imgs`.

The `thesis_code` folder contains the code used for analysis, as .ipynb files. This folder also contains a custom python package called *thesis*.

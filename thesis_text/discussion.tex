\chapter{Discussion}\label{discussion}
In this chapter you present all conclusions that can be drawn from the preceding chapters. Next, you discuss these findings and relate them to the scientific literature, including the literature mentioned in the introduction. You also discuss the limitations of your research and implications for further research and potentially society. Often it ends with a conclusion paragraph, under a sub-header.
\\\\
The discussion should not introduce any new findings; these should appear in the results section.

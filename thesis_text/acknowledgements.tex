\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all individuals and resources that contributed to the successful completion of this Bachelor's thesis.

First and foremost, I extend my deepest appreciation to my first supervisor, dr. Bernhard Englitz, for his guidance, feedback, and support throughout this research project. His expertise and encouragement were instrumental in shaping my understanding and approach.

I am also grateful to my second reader, dr. Kiki van der Heijden, for taking the time to read this work.

I wish to thank my friends and family for their continuous encouragement and support, which provided helpful comments, constructive criticism, and emotional support ever since the very beginning of this project.

In addition, I am thankful for the welcoming environment of the entire Computational Neuroscience Lab. I would like to thank the members of the lab for their friendliness and willingness to help and answer questions.

Finally, I acknowledge the indispensable role of various digital tools and software that facilitated the research and writing process. This includes, but is not limited to, the Python programming language, NumPy and SciPy libraries for data processing and analysis, and the Controller software developed within the lab. Most importantly, the DSTRF implementation provided by the Mesgarani lab was indispensible in making this project possible.

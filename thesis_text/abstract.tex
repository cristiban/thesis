This thesis aims to estimate the response kernels of auditory neurons by extracting deep spectro-temporal receptive fields (DSTRF) from calcium imaging data, a recently proposed model consisting of the linearization of a neural network. DSTRF improves upon traditional linear methods by providing more accurate and interpretable estimates of neuronal response kernels. This analysis will provide deeper insights into the functional organization of auditory neurons and improve our ability to predict neuronal responses to novel auditory stimuli.

After applying the DSTRF algorithm described above: training the CNN network, linearizing it and multiplying the weights, an interpretable movie visualization for every pixel $p$ of the calcium imaging recording was obtained. Shown below is a selection of such movies, compressed in order to save space in the document (raw, uncompressed videos are also provided, along with the full code).

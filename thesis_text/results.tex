\chapter{Results}\label{results}
Here, you describe the results you found in text and often figures. This section should normally describe only findings, no methods (see previous section) nor conclusions (see next section) yet. The order of the results discussed often follows the order of research questions or hypotheses. Again, depending on the field, there are different standards.
